# ServiceProtector Driver Security Guide

## Overview

This document provides security guidelines and best practices for developing, deploying, and using the ServiceProtector Windows kernel-mode driver. Since the driver operates at a high privilege level in the operating system, proper security practices are essential.

## Security Considerations for Development

### Secure Coding Practices

1. **Input Validation**
   - All user-mode inputs passed via IOCTLs must be thoroughly validated
   - Size checks should be performed on all buffers
   - Input strings should be properly null-terminated
   - Example from the code:
   ```c
   // Validate buffer size
   if (bufferSize < sizeof(WCHAR)) {
       SERVICE_PROTECTOR_PRINT("Input buffer too small");
       status = STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL;
       break;
   }

   if (bufferSize > sizeof(deviceContext->ServiceInfo.ServiceName)) {
       SERVICE_PROTECTOR_PRINT("Input buffer too large");
       status = STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER;
       break;
   }
   ```

2. **Memory Management**
   - Avoid memory leaks by properly freeing all allocated resources
   - Use safe string functions to prevent buffer overflows
   - Ensure all pointers are validated before use
   - Keep pool allocations to a minimum and track them properly

3. **Synchronization**
   - Use proper synchronization primitives for accessing shared data
   - The ServiceProtector driver uses `FAST_MUTEX` for protecting shared state:
   ```c
   ExAcquireFastMutex(&deviceContext->ServiceInfoMutex);
   // Access shared data here
   ExReleaseFastMutex(&deviceContext->ServiceInfoMutex);
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   - Always check return status from API calls
   - Gracefully handle error conditions
   - Include detailed error logging for debugging

### Secure Build Environment

1. **Development Machine Security**
   - Keep the development environment up-to-date with security patches
   - Use strong access controls on development machines
   - Enable BitLocker drive encryption if available

2. **Source Code Security**
   - Store source code in a secure, version-controlled repository
   - Implement code review processes for all changes
   - Use static code analysis tools to identify security vulnerabilities
   - Consider running the "Code Security Analysis" tool in Visual Studio

3. **Build Process**
   - Use clean build machines with minimal installed software
   - Enable compiler security features:
     - Control Flow Guard (/guard:cf)
     - Data Execution Prevention (/NXCOMPAT)
     - Address Space Layout Randomization (/DYNAMICBASE)

## Driver Signing Requirements

### Development Signing

For development and testing, you can use test signing:

1. Enable test signing mode on the test machine:
   ```
   bcdedit /set testsigning on
   ```

2. Create a test certificate:
   ```
   makecert -r -pe -ss PrivateCertStore -n "CN=ServiceProtectorTestCert" ServiceProtectorTestCert.cer
   ```

3. Sign the driver with the test certificate:
   ```
   signtool sign /a /v /s PrivateCertStore /n ServiceProtectorTestCert /t http://timestamp.digicert.com ServiceProtector.sys
   ```

### Production Signing

For production deployments, more rigorous signing is required:

1. **Microsoft Hardware Developer Center (WHQL) Certification**:
   - Submit the driver to the Microsoft Hardware Dashboard
   - Pass WHQL testing
   - Receive a digitally signed driver from Microsoft

2. **Extended Validation (EV) Code Signing Certificate**:
   - Obtain an EV Code Signing Certificate from an authorized CA
   - This requires hardware token-based certificate management
   - Follow the CA's verification procedures

3. **HVCI Readiness**:
   - Ensure the driver is compatible with Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity
   - Follow Microsoft's HVCI compatibility guidelines

## Secure Deployment

### Installation Security

1. **Verify Driver Integrity**:
   - Verify the driver's digital signature before installation
   - Check the certificate chain to ensure it's trusted
   ```
   signtool verify /v /pa ServiceProtector.sys
   ```

2. **Secure Installation Process**:
   - Use only administrator accounts for driver installation
   - Install from trusted media or secure network locations
   - Consider using deployment tools like SCCM for enterprise environments

3. **Service Configuration**:
   - Set appropriate service start types (typically "demand start")
   - Configure secure service recovery options

### Access Controls

1. **Device Object Security**:
   - The driver creates its device with restricted security descriptors:
   ```c
   deviceInit = WdfControlDeviceInitAllocate(driver, &SDDL_DEVOBJ_SYS_ALL_ADM_ALL);
   ```
   This restricts access to administrators and the system.

2. **Registry Security**:
   - Apply strict ACLs to the driver's registry keys
   - Ensure parameter registry keys are only modifiable by administrators

3. **Control Application Security**:
   - Any application that communicates with the driver should require elevated privileges
   - Implement proper access control in control applications
   - Consider using Windows security features like UAC and AppLocker

## Runtime Security

### Monitoring and Logging

1. **Event Logging**:
   - Implement extensive logging for security-relevant events
   - Log all configuration changes and protection events
   - Consider integrating with Windows Event Log for centralized monitoring

2. **Audit Trails**:
   - Maintain audit logs of all access attempts to protected services
   - Log details of denied access attempts with process information
   - Consider forwarding logs to a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system

### Protection Scope

1. **Current Protection**:
   The driver currently protects against:
   - Process termination (PROCESS_TERMINATE)
   - Memory writes for code injection (PROCESS_VM_WRITE)
   - Process suspension (PROCESS_SUSPEND_RESUME)

2. **Protection Limitations**:
   The driver does not protect against:
   - Kernel-mode attacks
   - Exploits targeting the driver itself
   - Physical access attacks
   - Attacks from processes with debug privileges

## Security Testing

   - Test edge cases in handle creation and access rights

3. **Compatibility Testing**:
   - Test with various Windows versions and service packs
   - Verify compatibility with security software
   - Test in virtualized environments

### Code Review

1. **Security-Focused Code Review**:
   - Review all IOCTL handlers for input validation
   - Examine synchronization logic for race conditions
   - Check memory management for leaks and use-after-free conditions
   - Validate proper cleanup in driver unload routines

2. **External Security Review**:
   - Consider hiring security experts for a thorough code audit
   - Address all discovered vulnerabilities before deployment
